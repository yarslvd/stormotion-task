**[Hosted version link](https://stormotion-task.vercel.app)**

## Launch
 
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Introduction
Two people are playing a game. From the pile of 25 matches, each player takes either 1, 2 or 3 matches on each turn. The game is over once all matches are taken. Whoever has the even amount of matches wins.

## Requirements
- You can use any JS framework, or even no framework at all;
- An app should have a user interface (not a command line);
- AI should make decisions based on an optimal strategy (not just picking a random number of matches);
- Give preference to Emoji instead of images;
- Share the result in a form of git repository with us.

## Bonus tasks
- Add a second mode where the first move is made by AI. The user can select the game mode;
- Implement the general solution when there are 2n + 1 matches in the pile and the number of matches allowed to take on each turn is from 1 to m. The user can adjust the parameters n and m.
